This repository contains the code for my Insight Data Science project completed in June 2018. A post describing the project is available at [legaleagle.site](http://www.legaleagle.site).

The script files are numbered in the order that they should be executed, from the acquisition of data through modeling. The one jupyter notebook is for the creation of charts used in the project description referenced above as well as a demo presentation not included here. These files are all contained in the "code" directory.

There are utility scripts in the util subdirectory. These should be self-explanatory.
